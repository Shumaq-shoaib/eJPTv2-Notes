## What is Information Gathering?

* The initial phase of any penetration test involves information gathering. This step revolves around gathering data about an individual, company, website, or system that is the target of the assessment.
* Success in the later stages of a penetration test is closely linked to the extent of information gathered about the target. In other words, the more comprehensive the data collected, the higher the chances of success.
* Information gathering can be categorized into two main types: passive and active.

### **Passive Information Gathering**

It entails collecting data without directly engaging with the target.

* Identifying IP addresses & DNS information.
* Identifying domain names and domain ownership information.
* Identifying email addresses and social media profiles.
* Identifying web technologies being used on target sites.
* Identifying subdomains

### **Active Information Gathering**

It involves actively interacting with the target system, but it requires proper authorization before being performed.

* Discovering open ports on target systems.
* Learning about the internal infrastructure of a target network/organization.
* Enumerating information from target systems.







## DNS

The Domain Name System (DNS) is a protocol utilized to translate domain names or hostnames into their corresponding IP addresses.

Back in the early days of the internet, users needed to remember the numeric IP addresses of the websites they wanted to visit. However, DNS solves this issue by providing a mapping between easily recallable domain names and their respective IP addresses.

Think of a DNS server (nameserver) as a telephone directory, which holds a database of domain names and their corresponding IP addresses.

Numerous public DNS servers have been established by companies such as Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) and Google (8.8.8.8). These DNS servers contain records for almost all domains on the internet.

### DNS Records

* A - Resolves a hostname or domain to an IPv4 address.
* AAAA - Resolves a hostname or domain to an IPv6 address.
* NS - Reference to the domains nameserver.
* MX - Resolves a domain to a mail server.
* CNAME - Used for domain aliases.
* TXT - Text record.
* HINFO - Host information.
* SOA - Domain authority.
* SRV - Service records.
* PTR - Resolves an IP address to a hostname

### DNS Interrogation

DNS interrogation refers to the act of querying a DNS server to retrieve the DNS records associated with a particular domain.

The primary goal of DNS interrogation is to obtain relevant DNS records for the specified domain.

Through this process, valuable information such as the domain's IP address, subdomains, mail server addresses, and other related details can be obtained.

### DNS Zone Transfer

In certain cases DNS server admins may want to copy or transfer zone files from one DNS server to another. This process is known as a zone transfer.

* If misconfigured and left unsecured, this functionality can be abused by attackers to copy the zone file from the primary DNS server to another DNS server.
* A DNS Zone transfer can provide penetration testers with a holistic view of an organization's network layout.
* Furthermore, in certain cases, internal network addresses may be found on an organization's DNS servers.
